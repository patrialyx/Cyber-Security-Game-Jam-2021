# Cyber-Security-Game-Jam-2021

"Hacked" is a 2D platformer adventure game that aims to educate users on password security. It clinched a Suitability prize at Cybersecurity Game Jam https://lnkd.in/g8wuV_5 organized by SecurityGames at UC Berkeley School of Information.

While the heart of typical indie games is the element of "fun", ensuring users walk away with new insights is equally important in the gamification of cybersecurity concepts. It was challenging conceptualizing a game design that preserved the factor of entertainment and excitement alongside the education aspect.
